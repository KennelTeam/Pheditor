# Pheditor

This is a very primitive photos editor.

It's written in pure kotlin and android jetpack kit.

### There are following features that work

- Loading and saving photo from (to) gallery
- Applying filters to photo
- (With bugs) drawing on photo

### And features that should work but in fact don't

- Cropping photo
- Adding stickers on photo
